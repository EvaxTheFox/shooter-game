My Python Shooter Game Made Using PyGame
==========================================================
# Things i Made For This:
* Aliens have different movement types based on their colors
* Missiles kill single aliens, the ship has an unlimited supply
* Bombs kill all aliens on screen and are scarce, use them wisely
* Powerups drop periodically and give either more bombs or a shield
* The shield powerup allows the ship to collide with 1 alien and survive
* High scores are recorded in an SQLite database
